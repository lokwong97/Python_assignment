# Analysis of Top Banks' Financial Data

This Python script scrapes financial data from the Wikipedia page "List of largest banks" and conducts visual analysis on the retrieved information. The script provides insights into the top global banks, presenting data such as market capitalization, total assets, and the distribution of banks by country.
